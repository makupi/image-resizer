## RESIZE

A small tool to potentially help emote artists resize their images faster/easier.

All sizes in pixels.

    112x112

## Usage

- Put all your .png files that you want to be resized in the `input` folder and run the `resize.exe`.     
- It will automatically resize them to the sizes mentioned above and put them into the `output` folder named as `file_size.png` (e.g. Kappa_112.png).
